	<p>A <u><i>network</i></u> is defined as the connection of at least two computer systems, either by a cable or a wireless connection.
         The simplest network is a combination of two computers connected by a cable. This type of network is called a <strong><em>peer-to-peer network</em></strong>. 
         There is no hierarchy in this network; both participants have equal privileges. 
         Each computer has access to the data of the other device and can share resources such as disk space, applications or peripheral devices (printers, etc.).
